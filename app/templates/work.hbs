    Below is a mixture of some of my work as a broadcast journalist, mixed in with some web development projects, and the content I’ve produced through my Masters Degree Courses. Today’s media specialist has to be comfortable with integrating new media technologies
    and social media strategies with the tried and true traditional communication skills. If you’d like more information on my work and education history, please visit the Resume section.

  <p class="work-graph">
    Since 2013, I've worked as broadcast journalist in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas. I've done just about everything in the small and medium size market newsroom. At KTVE in Monroe Louisiana, I started as the South Arkansas Bureau Reporter, before moving
    up to Weekend Anchor & Producer, and finally to Morning Anchor & Producer. In 2015, I made my way to our Little Rock Affiliate, before taking a break to complete my Masters Degree. In 2016, I made the move to Austin, Texas to work on Spectrum News and Capital Tonight. While on the political beat, I covered state and national politics, the 2016 presidential election, the Texas Legislature and other localized political stories. I
      also filled in on the Anchor desk from time to time.
