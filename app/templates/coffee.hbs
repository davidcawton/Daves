  <h3 class="contact-title">A Few Things You Should Know</h3>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    I was fortunate enough to grow up in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jacksonville+Beach,+FL/@30.280043,-81.439834,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e448e28901c491:0xdc19850db5b8fc15!8m2!3d30.2841224!4d-81.3961338" target="_blank">Jacksonville Beach, Florida</a>. When I took my first gig as a reporter in Louisiana, I never thought I'd miss the ocean as much as I did. Living so far inland made me appreciate what I took for granted: family, old friends
    and the Atlantic Ocean. With that said, I'd make the decision to pursue those dreams 100 times out of 100. No question about it. There is only one constant in life and that's change, so it's best to just embrace it and not fight too hard.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    After graduating from <a href="http://www.ju.edu/Pages/default.aspx" target="blank">Jacksonville University</a>with a BA in Broadcast Communications in 2013, I landed in the small town of El Dorado, Arkansas as a Bureau Reporter for <a href="http://www.myarklamiss.com/" target="_blank">KTVE-10 News</a>. I went from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida" target="_blank">largest city</a> in the country to one of the smallest.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    I was terrified to say the least.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    I was suddenly thrown into an uncomfortable situation: I had no friends, no idea about the place I was living in, and a dog that kept <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/gl5tGbED0Xx2UbyS7cJ_NhdpDFdHngq5fQyqo0/?taken-by=dvaidc" target="_blank">eating my stuff</a>. I found out quickly that the people and the story of El Dorado were worth more than I could have imagined.
    For 8 months, I worked on my own to cultivate stories by building relationships and becoming part of the community. I did a lot of driving, and made some mistakes along the way, but I believe there's a reason I ended up there. Turns out, El Dorado
    and the drive the town has to transform itself became the inspiration for my Masters Capstone project a few years later.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    Speaking of Masters Capstones, I should probably mention that around the 4-month mark in El Dorado, I decided it was time to go back to school. I found the perfect program at Quinnipiac University: an online Master of Science degree in <a href="https://quonline.quinnipiac.edu/online-programs/online-graduate-programs/ms-in-interactive-media/" target="_blank">Interactive Media</a>.
    I figured I could use the UX Design, Social Media, Production and Digital Media skills in the future if I wanted to keep up with change - you know, because that's always going to happen.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    Anyways, not to sound cleche, or toot my own horn, but hard work pays off.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    Just when I was getting used to the pace of South Arkansas, my News Director in Monroe, Louisiana - (where the actual station is located) - asked if I'd like to join the rest of the staff. A month later, and I was Anchoring and Producing the Weekend broadcasts.
    Then, in just a few months, opportunity found me again in the form of a 4am wake-up call from the boss, asking if I could fill-in on the Morning Show. Fast forward again, and the fill-in gig became a permanent move. For 3-hours every weekday, I helped
    pilot an energetic and social newscast with some of the best friends I've ever made. Cooking segments are the bomb dot com.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    As the morning show went on, another station in our network was looking for a reporter in Little Rock. After a few emails, an interview and a blessing from Big John, I was suddenly moving again. In all honesty, I wish I could tell you everything worked
    out for the best, but that would be a lie. During this time, my Graduate work was becoming a lot to handle. My work was slipping and I wasn't putting in enough effort to do both. After a short time in Little Rock, both sides decided I should focus
    on my education and the future.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    For the rest of 2015, I dove deep into my{{#link-to 'work.capstone'}} Graduate studies{{/link-to}}, and found a connection with all things content. From Social Media, Brand Journalism, & Strategic Planning, to Video Production and Web Development, I found my passion. Web Development especially
    caught my attention, and for the last year I've been learning as much as possible on the Front End. I'm currently trying to dig more into Ember Js and building web applications.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    After graduating in December, I found myself searching for a new path. As New Years came and went, I still didn't know where that path was going. That was until I received a call from a News Director in Austin Texas who stumbled upon my {{#link-to 'work.broadcast'}}Reporter Reels{{/link-to}}
    online. He was looking for a Political Reporter to cover the presidential election and state politics for <a href="http://www.twcnews.com/tx/austin.html" target="_blank">Spectrum News</a> - a 24-hour news channel. Once again, I found myself on a plane to a new city. I fell in love with the city of Austin, the tacos
    and vibrant community. After a few interviews, I took the job and hit the ground running.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    For most of 2016, I split my time covering the Texas angle of the Presidential Race, and learning the ins and outs of state politics. Over the summer, our show, Capital Tonight, spent two weeks on the road at the Republican and Democratic National Conventions.
    It was an experience I'll never forget. Texas has a lot of drama, big political personalities and important issues. I learned that keeping up with the Capital Press Corps was no easy task.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    Remember when I said change was constant? Yeah, that's still true.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    As October rolled around, my relationship with Spectrum News came to an end. Some things just aren't meant to be, and I'm not going to be the one who fights fate. I enjoyed working in news, but I also realized that it was just a job for me, and not something
    I'm necessarily passionate about. The truth hurts, but I think I'm better for understanding that.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    So what now?
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    At this moment, I'm looking for a fresh start. I'd love to work in web development, creative services, media relations, digital production, social media - or better yet - something that combines all of those disciplines. For now, I'm going to keep working
    on my Github commits, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiC1qLBsef4" target="_blank">filming dumb stuff with my dog</a>, and searching for the right fit.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    I tried to boil that story down to just the highlights... which is kind of the point of these things right? I failed to really talk about my {{#link-to 'social'}}experience{{/link-to}} as a video producer in college, my game-day experience with my hometown Jacksonville Jaguars, or my work
    with non-profits.
  </p>
  <p class="contact-graph__sm">
    For that, I think we can grab a cup of coffee, in person or on a Hangout. Hit me up and let's talk about change and the future.
